## Overview
This is a landing page for all the projects done within my CS 190 (Computer Audio and Music Programming) at UCI taught by Professor [Christopher Dobrian](https://dobrian.github.io/cmp/). As such, this page will primarily feature the projects accomplished in the duration of the class. This site will also contain exercises and experiments done to learn digital signal processing through Max.

These projects will be accomplished using JavaScript and its Web Audio API alongside Cycling '74's Max visual programming language.

## Projects

**Project 1: Hawaii Type-O**
: This is a program that plays drum hits as you type your name with a surprise at
the end when you press enter. This project is done purely through Javascript's
Web API
