Hi! Welcome to my site where I store my programming projects and maybe occasionally
blog about the more technical things I do as someone interested in audio and programming.
If you want to check out my full portfolio site please feel free to checkout my main site
over at *placeholder link*

I mainly focus on anything related to both audio and programming in games. This site will
contain my various projects related to that endeavor whether it be games themselves or
audio programs.

Currently, I'm planning to work on stuff with JUCE at some point once I have time
off my other obligations to school and existing projects.

##About Me
======
: Hey! I'm Johan Tan. I'm a senior Computer Science major at the University of California, Irvine (UCI). I am currently an officer for the Audio department at the Video Game Development Club at UCI [VGDC](https://sites.google.com/uci.edu/vgdcuci/home). I help club members by teaching informative workshops on topics ranging from basics of DAWs to implementing sounds into games using middleware. I also help members troubleshoot audio issues both in the DAW and in their game engine.

: Now one might ask, "What does a computer science major do with audio?". I enjoy the combination of the two disciplines I love so much whether it be creating tools to help sound designers create or work or implementing sounds into games, To achieve my goal to help sound designers (and because I love sound design so much), being a sound designer myself was a natural progression.
