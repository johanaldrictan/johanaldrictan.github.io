### Max Patch
[Download patch here](https://github.com/johanaldrictan/johanaldrictan.github.io/raw/master/files/Johan_Tan-SubSynth.zip)

### How to use the Max Patch

This Max patch allows you to use it through a midi controller or through the screen of the patch itself! There are also options for pitch bend and mod wheel. The mod wheel changes the frequency of a sine wave that is modulating the amplitude of the oscillators.

Other than that, pick a waveform, mess with the mix and have fun with it!
